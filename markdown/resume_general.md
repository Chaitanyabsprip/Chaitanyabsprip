## Experience

**SolarSquare** (Feb 2024 - Present): Full Stack Developer II  
Technologies: *Python, NestJs, Typescript, Nodejs, Postgres, Dart,
Flutter, Apache Airflow, MongoDB, Firebase.*

- Implemented a python program that runs in airflow and synchronizes
    data between a third party database and our database.
- Developed an application with simple CRUD operations and complex
    state management requirements.

**Yocket** (Aug 2021 - Jan 2024): Mobile Application Developer II  
Technologies: *Dart, Flutter, Make, Gitlab CI-CD, Bitbucket CI-CD,
Fastlane, Sqlite, Firebase, GraphQL, Hasura.*

- Implemented realtime chat functionality which resulted in 2x
    increase in user-retention and engagement. Reduced Initial load time
    of the chat module from 2s to 0 by re-architecting the code to use
    asynchronous loading. Decreased message load time by 60%.
- Worked in a cross-functional team closely collaborating with the
    back-end API team, Product Managers, Designers and Founders to
    deliver business-relevant features, sometimes without complete
    written requirements.
- Performed product experiments to improve conversion from
    TOFU(signed-up) to MOFU (schedule a call) for the sales funnel. This
    was done independent of the Product Team and also led to a small
    number of conversions to paying users.
- Added performance optimizations for fluid user interaction. App
    startup time reduced from 4-6s to 400-500ms.
- Implemented a deployment pipeline which resulted in a 8x reduction
    in build times.
- Held responsibility for mentoring and training an intern.
- Established notification systems using firebase with multiple
    channels

**Zargun ES** (Dec 2019 - May 2020): Mobile Application Developer
Intern
