      I’m Chaitanya, a software engineer based in Mumbai who enjoys turning
      complex problems into elegant, maintainable solutions. I work across the
      stack, with a focus on backend systems in Go, Python, and TypeScript, and
      the occasional mobile app in Flutter.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I enjoy designing systems that are elegant in structure yet practical in
      delivery. Code that evolves and adapts to changing requirements quickly.
    </p>
    <br />
    I believe in:
    <ul class="list-disc pl-8">
      <li>
        building systems that are reliable, observable, and easy to maintain;
      </li>
      <li>in the Unix philosophy, <em>Do one thing well</em>;</li>
      <li>
        that programs should be written for humans to understand first, and
        machines to run second;
      </li>
      <li>
        keeping curiosity alive — because the best ideas come from exploring the
        unknown.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
      When I’m not shipping production code, you’ll find me tinkering with
      open-source projects, experimenting with developer tooling, or diving into
      performance tuning just for the fun of it. My favourite kind of work? The
      kind that feels effortless to use but took hours of thought to get just
      right.
