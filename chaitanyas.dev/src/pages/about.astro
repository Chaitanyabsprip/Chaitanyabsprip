    <p>
      I'm Chaitanya, a software engineer who believes in the art of
      optimization. My journey in tech has been driven by a simple question:
      "How can we make this better?"
    </p>

    <div class="my-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl mb-2">Work & Impact</h2>
      <p class="mb-2">
        As a fullstack engineer, I work across the entire development spectrum,
        from crafting efficient backend systems in Go, TypeScript, and Python to
        building fluid mobile experiences with Flutter. But what truly excites
        me is the architecture behind these systems, the invisible patterns that
        determine how well software scales, performs, and evolves.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        My obsession with optimization extends beyond just making things faster.
        It's about finding the most elegant solution to complex problems. In my
        professional work, this philosophy has led me to successfully optimize
        enterprise chat systems and architect high-performance notification
        delivery systems, consistently delivering performance gains.

      <h2 class="text-2xl mb-4">What drives me</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-8">
        <li>Create experiences that serve users and empower developers</li>
        <li>Build efficient systems that scale and perform</li>
        <li>Automate processes that make development more enjoyable</li>
        <li>Explore software architecture and design patterns</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="my-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl mb-4">Philosophy</h2>
      <p class="mb-2">
        I'm a firm believer in the terminal's power. In a world of flashy GUIs,
        I find beauty in the constraint of the command line. It's where I spend
        most of my time, from coding in Neovim to interacting with AI models.
        This isn't just about personal preference - it's about the fundamental
        efficiency of text-based interfaces. When you strip away the pixels,
        you're forced to think deeply about user experience in functional terms.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        This love for terminal-based workflows naturally led me into the world
        of developer tooling. Over time, I've built an ecosystem of tools that
        make development more efficient - from Neovim plugins that streamline
        code actions to a comprehensive suite of shell scripts that automate
        repetitive tasks.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        Beyond coding, I'm drawn to the philosophical aspects of software
        development. How should we organize code? What makes an interface
        intuitive? When is optimization premature? These questions fascinate me,
        and I explore them through technical writing and open-source
        contributions. I believe in sharing knowledge and learning publicly -
        there's something powerful about thinking out loud and being open to
        better ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether I'm architecting backend systems, crafting mobile experiences,
        or building developer tools, my goal remains consistent: create software
        that's not just functional, but thoughtfully designed and efficiently
        implemented.
