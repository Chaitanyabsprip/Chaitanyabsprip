          <strong>SolarSquare</strong> (Feb 2024 - Present): Full Stack
          Developer II<br />
          Technologies:
          <em>
            Python, NestJs, Typescript, Nodejs, Postgres, Dart, Flutter, Apache
            Airflow, MongoDB, Firebase.

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Implemented a python program that runs in airflow and synchronizes
            data between a third party database and our database.
          </li>
          <li>
            Developed an application with simple CRUD operations and complex
            state management requirements.

          <strong>Yocket</strong> (Aug 2021 - Jan 2024): Mobile Application
          Developer II<br />
          Technologies:
          <em>
            Dart, Flutter, Make, Gitlab CI-CD, Bitbucket CI-CD, Fastlane,

        <ul>
          <li>
            Implemented realtime chat functionality which resulted in 2x
            increase in user-retention and engagement. Reduced Initial load time
            of the chat module from 2s to 0 by re-architecting the code to use
            asynchronous loading. Decreased message load time by 60%.
          </li>
          <li>
            Worked in a cross-functional team closely collaborating with the
            back-end API team, Product Managers, Designers and Founders to
            deliver business-relevant features, sometimes without complete
            written requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
            Performed product experiments to improve conversion from
            TOFu(signed-up) to MOFu(schedule a call) for the sales funnel. This
            was done independent of the Product Team and also led to a small
            number of conversions to paying users.
          </li>
          <li>
            Added performance optimizations for fluid user interaction. App
            startup time reduced from 4-6s to 400-500ms.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implemented a deployment pipeline which resulted in a 8x reduction
            in build times.
          </li>
          <li>Held responsibility for mentoring and training an intern.</li>
          <li>
            Established notification systems using firebase with multiple
